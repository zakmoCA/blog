# Second-Order Fun

**Date Published: July 5, 2020**

The best way to forecast the long term consequences of our actions and decisions is to utilise second-order thinking.

First order thinking refers to thinking concerned with the immediate or obvious effects of an action. Second order thinking is more deliberate, necessarily taking many things into account. It is the thinker asking “and then what?”.

In other words it is thinking done after the thinking. Therefore second order consequences are the long-term consequences of the initial action. It is easiest to think of them as the ‘unintended consequences’.

A lot of the time, second order effects are hard to predict, and second order thinking in general is difficult, so we almost never do it.

Howard Marks who is an investor and the co-founder of Oaktree Capital, writes in his book ‘The Most Important Thing’:

“First-level thinking is simplistic and superficial, and just about everyone can do it (a bad sign for anything involving an attempt at superiority). All the first-level thinker needs is an opinion about the future, as in “The outlook for the company is favourable, meaning the stock will go up.” Second-level thinking is deep, complex and convoluted.”

People who overweigh the first-order consequences of their decisions and ignore the effects of second and subsequent-order consequences of those decisions rarely reach their goals.

Being able to think through problems in the second, or third, or nth order is a powerful tool which supercharges our thinking and decision making ability.

We can apply the concepts of first and second order thinking to fun and satisfaction. An action is first order fun/satisfying when its reward is immediate, whereas an action is second order fun/satisfying when it is not immediately exciting but whose consequences lead to satisfaction later.

Most of the fun we can have in life is first order fun. First order fun indulges the senses, and indeed all hedonism is rooted in it. This article isn’t a rallying cry against first order fun or a moral stance against hedonism, but an attempt at a model for maximizing life satisfaction and enjoyment.

Eating pizza, a night of drinking, netflix binges, these things are all first-order fun. They provide instant gratification, there’s no waiting for the reward of performing these actions, compared to say, preparing for a presentation you really want to nail. This is why you and I will take the former over the latter any day, until that day is the day before that presentation is due. You and I can probably also agree that the reward of a genuine accomplishment is felt far more deeply than the immediate “hey I’m enjoying this” reward of a fun night of binge-drinking.

Second-order satisfaction is akin to the fulfillment one feels after finishing a project, or nailing a job interview for example. The actual process of completing the project or preparing for the job interview and the interview itself may not be the most exciting, and could in fact be fraught with anxiety. However, no one can deny that the feeling one gets after such undertakings is satisfying on a much deeper level than that of first-order fun like a netflix binge.

It’s also obvious to see that while my aforementioned pastimes provide first order fun, too much of them will lead to negative consequences in the long-term. In other words they are first-order fun, but second-order ‘not fun‘.

The return on investment for first-order fun diminishes precipitously with time. This is because the enjoyment will last for only as long as we are doing the action ie. eating the ice-cream.

The degree to which the second-order effects are ‘not-fun‘ depends on the action in question. The negative effects of long term cocaine use will for example obviously eclipse the long term effects of compulsive social media scrolling.

It is important to note that not all first-order fun is necessarily second-order not-fun, however the vast majority is, due to our neurochemical bias for an immediate payoff. This is a crucial point to understand if one wants to make good decisions which optimise for long-term fulfilment and happiness.

I contend that as humans we have a stronger bias for dissatisfaction, disappointment, and negative emotions in general.

If we want to maximize contentment, we need to limit the amounts of these emotions we feel, as negative events and feelings disproportionately affect our mood and contentment compared to positive events and feelings.

In other words our highs aren’t felt nearly to the same extent as our lows. The highs of first-order fun are fleeting, whilst the lows of our discontentment and regret can literally keep us up at night.

We sometimes reach a point in life where we are stuck in a rut, and where we are not as content and satisfied as we could be. This is almost invariably due to past decisions whose second order consequences have led to us feeling this way.

The reason I rambled on about second-order thinking earlier is that very few of us would consciously make decisions with the knowledge that those decisions would ultimately lead to dissatisfaction or regret later on.

And yet we continue to make these decisions, not because we want to end up feeling discontented or unhappy (obviously), but due to an inability or unwillingness to probe our actions and decisions beyond the first level.

Maybe we are in a career we hate because we took the easy option of a secure paycheck over following our dream path, because it was less painful and more bountiful in the short-term, and therefore more appealing at the time. Maybe our relationship or marriage has gone down the drain due to a lack of trust or communication and boundaries, which would have taken some difficult conversations to establish. However as always we opted for the easy, and less uncomfortable option of ignoring these issues and letting resentment build, since difficult but honest conversations are first-order ‘not fun‘.

If we only do what feels good and is easy in the moment, and avoid the difficult things which provide great benefit and contentment once done, we are opting for a discontent life down the road. The tipping point arrives when second order dissatisfaction from past decisions outweighs first order fun from current actions. Think of the rush of the first cocaine high versus the day you find yourself jobless, homeless, and living on the sidewalk. In the beginning that cocaine was first order very fun, but obviously it’s second-order consequences in this example can be appropriately termed not fun. Now most people reading this probably don’t have a cocaine habit, but would still do well to approach decisions with this model.

This crossover point is reached when the negative second-order effects from past actions have accumulated to the point that we can no longer enjoy the fun first-order effects from those actions, or at least not in good conscience.

This is the point most of us decide enough is enough and it’s time to make a change. It’s the point when what we see in the mirror or on our most recent checkup hurts more than eating that tub of ice-cream feels good.

The reason this model can provide useful is because in life, the things that most contribute to our happiness, health, wealth, life satisfaction and fulfillment are very often not first-order fun.

Things like exercising regularly, eating healthy, building healthy spending and saving habits, working on your goals etc are all demanding and sometimes downright unpleasant in the short-term compared to staying in our comfort zone.

Furthermore, we have a brain that is wired to prioritise short term pleasure and avoid any kind of discomfort be it physical or mental.

If we were to do what maximizes enjoyment at any given moment, we’d pick pizza over a well balanced meal, frivolous spending over healthy finances, a movie marathon over a gruelling workout session/working towards ones goals. Doing hard shit right now will lead to one feeling amazing later, but in the present hard shit is just that, hard.

So what can we do?

The key to this model, much like in investing, is diversification. Diversification of the type of ‘fun’ activities we engage in is essential. First-order satisfaction is okay in moderation (night out on the town), but don’t forget to sprinkle in some second-order satisfaction in there too (working on our goals). The point of this model is to replace our natural programming which will always prioritize first-order fun, even though that may not be what we really want, or what really leads to our fulfillment and happiness in the long run.

Summary: Actions whose value is realized in the second order (delayed gratification) are often far more impactful on ones well-being and fulfillment than actions whose value is realized in the first order (instant gratification). Since fulfillment ultimately rests so heavily on the former, we should not make decisions based purely on ‘what feels good now/is easy now’, and utilize this framework in assessing the satisfaction/dissatisfaction potential of each decision, to ensure we are always optimizing for fulfillment, keeping in mind the brains bias for instant gratification, and the first-order fun etiology of almost all second-order discontentment (at best) and misery (at worst).
