# Seneca on Saving Time 

**Date Published: September 15, 2022**

In a letter to his friend Lucilius, Seneca expounds on his observation that time, although perhaps our most valuable resource, is often squandered, and treated almost like something of no real worth. The letter serves as both a warning and an exhortation to Lucilius, and I believe also serves as a reminder to Seneca himself, as is often the case with his letters.

Continue to act thus, my dear Lucilius – set yourself free for your own sake; gather and save your time, which till lately has been forced from you, or filched away, or has merely slipped from your hands.

Make yourself believe the truth of my words, – that certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach. The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness.

Seneca on Saving Time, Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium
It is very easy for us to squander our time when we are not intentional about how we want to spend it. it doesn’t necessarily have to be the obvious procrastination either. It can be saying yes to commitments which do not advance your interpersonal or professional goals, spending countless hours responding to emails instead of doing the tasks that create the real value for your company, mindless scrolling when you were only supposed to “reply to one tweet”.

Some moments are gently removed, as is the case with the social media vortex, and some are forced from us, as is the case with the compulsion to stay on top of email/meetings in cases where they take up a significantly greater time than is needed.

The most disgraceful kind of loss, and the one that immediately comes to mind when I think of wasted time, is that due to carelessness, or good old procrastination. Whether this be due to insufficient planning, or due to straight up vegging out on the couch as opposed to doing something genuinely fun and stimulating, the result is the same; time spent doing things that neither make us healthier, happier, or wealthier.

What person can you show me who places any value on their time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that they are dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years lie behind us are in death’s hands.

Seneca here utters some of his most powerful words, words which have personally transformed the way I view time. He says we are mistaken when we look forward to death, in thinking that death is something that happens in the future.

The truth is that the major portion of death has already passed. Since we cannot rewind the clock, and the days behind us are lost to time, whatever years be behind us are in deaths hands.

Therefore, Lucilius, do as you write me that you are doing: hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold of today’s task, and you will not need to depend so much upon tomorrow’s. While we are postponing, life speeds by.

Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession. What fools these mortals be! They allow the cheapest and most useless things, which can easily be replaced, to be charged in the reckoning, after they have acquired them; but they never regard themselves as in debt when they have received some of that precious commodity, – time! And yet time is the one loan which even a grateful recipient cannot repay.

We are often frugal in how we spend our wealth, and are diligent in guarding our personal property, but as soon as it comes to squandering time we are most wasteful of the one thing in which it is right to be stingy.

Seneca makes the observation that we take out loans in order to acquire things, but never regard ourselves as in debt to nature for the time she has given us, and that time is the one loan that not even a grateful recipient can repay.

I advise you, however, to keep what is really yours; and you cannot begin too early. For, as our ancestors believed, it is too late to spare when you reach the dregs of the cask. Of that which remains at the bottom, the amount is slight, and the quality is vile. Farewell.

The amount of time left to us when we are old is slight, and we do not have the energy and virility of our youth. Yet so much of our work culture is predicated on the deferred life plan; spend the best years of your life paying little attention to how you spend our time (as long as you receive a paycheque), so that we can relax in our retirement in old age.

But what if you get to retirement and realise you don’t really like sipping cocktails on a beach somewhere? What if you get to retirement and realise, that you spent most of your life doing something, not because you loved it, or even because you absolutely had to in order to keep the lights on, but because you never really bothered to explore other things you DO enjoy and figure out how to make a living doing that? What if you realised all you really cared about was spending quality time with your kids, but you were always stuck at the office?
