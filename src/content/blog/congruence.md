# Congruence As A Life Hack

**Date Published: August 2, 2020**

“Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last” says James Clear in his best-seller Atomic Habits.

What James Clear is referring to here by ‘congruence’ is an idea explored by American Psychologist Carl Rogers, building on the work of Abraham Maslow and Maslow’s heirarchy. Rogers believed that for a person to achieve self-actualization, they must be in a state of congruence.

When our ideal self, and our actual self are consistent or very similar, a state of congruence exists. Naturally, it is rare for one to achieve a state of total congruence.

Rogers believed that we want to feel, experience, and behave in ways consistent with our self-image.

This has profound implications for someone on the journey of self-development.

If for example, we think of ourselves as ‘not a runner’ then it is much easier to skip out on our run for the afternoon, as we are not technically acting inconsistently with our perceived identity.

One of the key things James Clear harps on about in Atomic Habits is just how much ‘identity change’ matters in establishing and maintaining habits.

The thesis of the book is that instead of thinking ‘I want to do x’ we need to instead think ‘I want to be the kind of person that does x’ or ‘I want to be an x person’.

So instead of ‘I want to start running’, think ‘I want to be a runner’. Once something is ingrained in our identity, performing the action is effortless, as we are just ‘being ourselves’.

I like to use my own version of this, that I call the ‘congruence hack’.

This is done by performing an action which in turn forces me to perform another action, just so as to stay consistent with the first action.

Otherwise it will have been for nothing and pretty stupid to have done.

I’m not really a morning person, but I make it a habit to always wake up early and to get started on my days work around 5am.

My reasoning is that if I wake up at 5am, get out of bed, shower, and pour myself a cup of tea, it would then be inconceivable to do anything else but attack the days work that is in front of me.

Because why else would I have left the comfort of my bed a few hours before I needed to?
