# Friction, And Why You Should Get A Kindle

**Date Published: September 6, 2020**

If you are an avid reader, or would like to read more, purchasing a kindle has probably crossed your mind.

I had been entertaining the idea for some time in 2019 when I decided to just do it, and boy has it been worth it.

Before buying the kindle, I had read only three books in the previous twelve months, something I was hoping to improve.

In the twelve months since purchasing it, I have completed 48 books, almost a book a week!

Now you’d think I would be happy with this progress, but actually when I sat down one day and really thought about why I’ve managed to read so much more over the last year compared to the year before, I arrived at an unsettling conclusion.

The only thing that had changed upon purchasing the kindle was that it removed a lot of the friction in the way of reading.

I no longer needed to go to the library/bookstore for books.

No needing to carry heavy books with me on my travels.

I would simply purchase/download the books I’m interested in en masse and pick up the kindle whenever I felt like reading.

The reason I find this unsettling is that none of these reasons concern desire or motivation.

I was not any more motivated to read over the last year than I had been the year before.

I did not desire or value reading any less in my three-book year.

I would just as often find myself coming across a title I want to read and putting a reminder in my phone to get it at the library or purchase it.

But I rarely did.

The sheer difference in reading volume across the two years is simply due to this idea of friction.

I am deeply fascinated by the neuroscience and psychology of habit formation and performance, and so had come across one of the core tenants of behaviour change, “make it easier”, many times.

However, this past week I was given a masterclass on this topic in the form of Roger Dooley’s “FRICTION: The Untapped Force That Can Be Your Most Powerful Advantage”. Roger Dooley is a keynote speaker, marketing consultant and Forbes contributor.

So what is friction?

In physics, friction is the resistance to motion of one object moving relative to another.

Friction always works in the direction opposite to the direction in which the object is moving or trying to move.

Roger Dooley describes how friction can result in lost profits for companies both on the consumer end in losing sales and on the labour end in terms of lost workplace productivity. This idea can also be applied to our own personal projects and goals.

Let’s say you have the goal of eating healthier and want to shed a few pounds, and one of your sticking points is the amount of takeaway lunches you have at work.

A solution to this could be to pack your healthy lunch every morning before work, or bulk prep your meals in advance.

The idea is that when the moment of hunger arrives, eating healthy isn’t the harder option to do, because you already have some healthy and delicious ready-made meals, which are even quicker to prepare than takeaways thanks to microwaves.

Most of the time our brain is not so much concerned with doing the right or wrong thing, so much as the easy thing.

If we make the right thing easier to do, we dramatically increase our likelihood of doing it, as we already have an inclination to want to do the right thing to begin with.

Sometimes we just need a little nudging is all. BJ Fogg is the author of Tiny Habits, and at Stanford he directs the Behaviour Design Lab.


Fogg Behaviour Model
In the figure above, you can see the Fogg Behaviour Model.

The model proposes that three elements must converge at the same moment for a behaviour to occur: motivation, ability, and a trigger. When a behaviour does not occur, at least one of those three elements is missing.

As can be observed by the action line, the harder something is to do, the more motivation is required to do it, and the opposite is true.

If you want a behaviour to take place, looking for ways to boost motivation or ability is the key.

However, boosting ability is far more effective.

Most of us already have pretty sincere desires and motivations when it comes to the things we want to do and can still be no closer to progress than we were yesterday.

Making the behaviour easier to do, or in other words, reducing the friction of said behaviour has a much more profound effect on the slope of the action line.

Throwing your gym bag and clothes in the car before work so it is that much easier to train after work. Prepping your healthy meals for the week so it is that much easier to stick to your diet later on when cravings strike. All these things reduce the levels of motivation needed in the moment, as the behaviour has now become easier to do.

Decision fatigue is a real thing, and the less we have to summon extraordinary sums of willpower to do the right thing in the moment, the more likely we are to do it.

In the landmark 1998 study, Muraven and colleagues showed how self-control is a limited resource, much like a muscle, which gets depleted with use throughout the day.

As the day wears on, the less willpower we will have to do/not do certain things, which is why reducing friction and therefore needing substantially smaller amounts of willpower is effective.

Reading for me no longer involves having to go all the way to the bookstore or library to find a book, it is as simple as purchasing it on my kindle, which is never too far away.

By simply making it easier to do, it is now a habit. No extra motivation necessary.

Ever since then, I have been trying to find areas of friction in other parts of my life and either reduce it to promote a certain behaviour or increase it to avoid others.

There is a quote often attributed to Bill Gates where he says he always finds a lazy person to do a hard job because the lazy person will find an easy way to do it.

If we treat ourselves like that lazy person and try to remove as much obstacles from our path to increase our likelihood of success, we will do much better than the slightly stronger-willed version of ourselves who is always swimming against the tide.
